    <h1>Services</h1>

    <h2><b>Voice over internet protocol (VoIP)</b></h2>
        <p>Voice over internet protocol is a communication tool for businesses.
             VoIP allows team members to make calls and send messages through their
              internet connections instead of through a phone line. This helps with
               internal long-distance communication for businesses that may have offices
                in different locations. Most VoIP services require paid subscriptions, which
                 businesses can use with traditional phone services or as an alternative.

        <h2><b>Backup solutions</b></h2>
        <p>Backup solutions protect information loss from occurring by storing
            copies of data on external hardware or online platforms, such as a
            cloud service. Information backup services can help protect your 
            business' information should any issues occur, like a power outage
            or system failure. Many information backup services exist, such as
            file backup, server backup and even desktop backup. Businesses can
            schedule automatic backups for their files to save the most recent 
            versions of the files they create to ensure data is secure.
        </p>
        <h2><b>Monitoring</b></h2>
        <p>IT services can monitor your network, internet traffic, computers 
            and other internet-enabled devices. Monitoring allows IT teams to 
            keep track of who accesses their businesses' information, whether 
            any technology requires repairs and if any computers need software 
            updates or modifications. Essentially, this IT service ensures that 
            your team members have the tools and resources they need to complete their tasks.
